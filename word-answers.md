Before comparing the four hashes,
the following table helps describing what the individual hashes stand for.

#### Gas cost

```text
SHA256 < Poseidon < MiMC < Pedersen
```

[This post](https://ethresear.ch/t/gas-and-circuit-constraint-benchmarks-of-binary-and-quinary-incremental-merkle-trees-using-the-poseidon-hash-function/7446)
compares gas cost
(or [gas price](https://discord.com/channels/942318442340560917/969554923396153345/973791442197692416), to be more precise)
of the three hashes out of the four:

![gas-costs-for-mimc-and-poseidon.png](./images/gas-costs-for-mimc-and-poseidon.png)

On the other hand,
the Pedersen hash is less efficient to compute than MiMC
(cf. [this comment](https://github.com/clearmatics/zeth/issues/4#issuecomment-484262945)).

#### Capacity

```text
SHA256 < MiMC = Poseidon = Pedersen
```

As clarified in [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/942318442340560917/969583198990401566/973943128086171668),
capacity means *"the number of inputs it can take in circomlib templates."*
Looking at the implementation in
[CircomLib v2.0.3](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib/tree/v2.0.3),
we notice that the templates for hash functions have the following number of inputs.

- [`Sha256`](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib/blob/v2.0.3/circuits/sha256/sha256.circom#L7): 1 input
- [`Sha256_2`](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib/blob/v2.0.3/circuits/sha256/sha256_2.circom#L26-L27): 2 inputs
- [`MiMC7`](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib/blob/v2.0.3/circuits/mimc.circom#L22): 1 input
- [`MultiMiMC7`](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib/blob/v2.0.3/circuits/mimc.circom#L140): Any number of inputs
- [`MiMCSponge`](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib/blob/v2.0.3/circuits/mimcsponge.circom#L7): Any number of inputs
- [`MiMCFeistel`](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib/blob/v2.0.3/circuits/mimcsponge.circom#L40-L41): 2 inputs
- [`Poseidon`](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib/blob/v2.0.3/circuits/poseidon.circom#L68): Any number of inputs
- [`Pedersen`](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib/blob/master/circuits/pedersen.circom#L177): Any number of inputs

Note that, for the MiMC hash family,
the input signal `k`,
which represents a (uniformly randomly chosen secret) key,
does not count for the number of inputs
(cf. [MiMC](https://byt3bit.github.io/primesym/mimc/)).

## Part 2. Tornado Cash

### Part 2 Q1

> How is Tornado Cash Nova different from Tornado Cash Classic? What are the key upgrades/improvements and what changes in the technical design make these possible?

The Tornado Cash team wrote a
[blog entry](https://tornado-cash.medium.com/tornado-cash-introduces-arbitrary-amounts-shielded-transfers-8df92d93c37c)
when introducing Tornaco Cash Nova,
in which they explain the following three improvements over Tornado Cash Classic:

1. In Nova, users can deposit and withdraw arbitrary amounts. In Classic, deposit and withdraw are limited to a few choices of fixed amounts.
2. In Nova, users can transfer deposited token to others without withdrawing them from the Tornado Pool.
3. Nova uses the Gnosis Chain as Layer2.

At a technical level,
Tornado Cash Classic needs a lot of smart contracts for its operation, such as for

- 0.1 ETH, 1 ETH, 10 ETH, 100 ETH, 100 DAI, 1,000 DAI, 10,000 DAI and 100,000 DAI on the Ethereum Mainnet,
- 100 DAI, 1,000 DAI, 10,000 DAI and 100,000 DAI on the xDAI blockchain

(See ["Tornado Cash smart contracts"](https://docs.tornado.cash/general/tornado-cash-smart-contracts) for the full list).

On the other hand, Tornado Cash Nova is based on the following five smart contracts

- Contract, Lâ€‹1 Omnibridge Helper, Verifier 2, Verifier 16, Hasher

on the Ethereum Mainnet only.
In particular, there is no need for smart contracts corresponding to specific deposit/withdraw amounts.
It also makes use of [OmniBridge](https://omni.xdaichain.com/bridge),
effectively excluding the need to deploy smart contracts on other blockchains.

### Part 2 Q2

> What is the role of the relayers in the Tornado Cash protocols? Why are relayers needed?

Usage of Tornaco Cash without relayers would be the following.

1. Account A creates a public-private keypair.
2. Account A deposits tokens to (i.e. transfer tokens to) the Tornado Pool while showing her public key.
3. Account B withdraws tokens using the keypair.

In order to send a withdrawal transaction,
Account B, which is typically a newly created address without any initial ETH balance,
would need to pay the gas price.
To retain anonymity, however,
it does not make sense for Account A to send a small amount of ETH to Account B,
for that transaction would be fully visible on the blockchain.
Such a small transaction would be cost-inefficient either.

A relayer acts as a third-party and performs the withdrawal process above on behalf of Account B.
With relayers, there is no need to send small-amount transactions,
making **Tornado Cash both anonymous and cost efficient at the same time**.

Tornaco Cash Documentation "[How to become a relayer?"](https://docs.tornado.cash/general/how-to-become-a-relayer) provides additional details on relayers.

## Part 3. Semaphore

### Part 3 Q1

> What is Semaphore? Explain in 4-8 sentences how it works.

Resources:

- [Medium blog: *"To Mixers and Beyond: presenting Semaphore, a privacy gadget built on Ethereum"*](https://medium.com/coinmonks/to-mixers-and-beyond-presenting-semaphore-a-privacy-gadget-built-on-ethereum-4c8b00857c9b)
- [Semaphore Documentation: *"What Is Semaphore?"*](https://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/docs/introduction)

### Part 3 Q2

> How does Semaphore prevent double signing (or double withdrawal in the case of mixers)? Explain the mechanism in 4-8 sentences.

As explained in the [Medium blog post](https://medium.com/coinmonks/to-mixers-and-beyond-presenting-semaphore-a-privacy-gadget-built-on-ethereum-4c8b00857c9b),
Semaphore prevents double signing via a state variable called `externalNullifier`.
When the `externalNullifier` of the Semaphore smart contract is `foo`,
then each user (say Alice) has right to broadcast a signal of her choice just once.
If Alice would like to broadcast a signal (regardless of whether it is equal to or different from the previous one) after she has already exercised the right to do so,
then she has to wait for the `externalNullifier` to change from `foo` to `bar`.

If we look at the [source code](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore) of Semaphore,
then the mechanism against double-signaling becomes more apparent.
At the Circom level,
the
[`externalNullifier`](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/blob/d88e4e9146d371c5568d319b9b121ff609146f49/circuits/semaphore.circom#L54)
is a
[public input signal](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/blob/d88e4e9146d371c5568d319b9b121ff609146f49/circuits/semaphore.circom#L90)
of the `Semaphore` component which, together with the
[`identityNullifier`](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/blob/d88e4e9146d371c5568d319b9b121ff609146f49/circuits/semaphore.circom#L48)
private input signal,
[Poseidon-hashes to](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/blob/d88e4e9146d371c5568d319b9b121ff609146f49/circuits/semaphore.circom#L69-L71)
the output signal
[`nullifierHash`](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/blob/d88e4e9146d371c5568d319b9b121ff609146f49/circuits/semaphore.circom#L87).

```text
nullifierHash = poseidon(externalNullifier, identityNullifier)
```

At the Solidity level, the
[`Semaphore`](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/blob/d88e4e9146d371c5568d319b9b121ff609146f49/contracts/Semaphore.sol#L90-L92)
contract
[saves](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/blob/d88e4e9146d371c5568d319b9b121ff609146f49/contracts/base/SemaphoreCore.sol#L49-L51
)
the `nullifierHash` to its own state after each proof verfication,
and it
[requires](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/blob/d88e4e9146d371c5568d319b9b121ff609146f49/contracts/base/SemaphoreCore.sol#L33)
that the `nullifierHash` has not already be seen before each proof verification.
Semaphore prevents double signing this way under the hood.

### Part 3 Q3

> A lot of applications have already been built based on derivations from Semaphore, such as for voting (e.g. [AnonyVote](https://github.com/TosinShada/anonyvote)), survey or opinion (e.g. [Ninja Survey](https://github.com/ChubbyCub/survey-on-chain-hh), [zkAsk](https://github.com/violetwee/zkAsk)), and authentication (e.g. [InterRep](https://github.com/interep-project/reputation-service), [Continuum](https://github.com/tomoima525/continuum), [zkPayroll](https://github.com/Harsh8196/Harmony-ZKU/tree/main/ZKPayroll/Backend)). Can you suggest two more ideas for ZK applications that can be built upon Semaphore?
